        <h1>Here Comes the Lockdown, Welcome to Dallas</h1>
        <p><em>⸻</em></p>
        <p>I packed my car, left behind everything I knew, and landed in Dallas the day before the world shut down. March 2020. No job lined up, no friends waiting for me — just instinct and the belief that this city could be a new start.</p>
        <p>I woke up the next morning and the city was closed. Lockdown. Quarantine. Stay inside. Don’t breathe near anyone. I barely had time to figure out how to get to the grocery store before people started panic-buying toilet paper.</p>
        <p>You’d think that would’ve been a sign.</p>
        <p>But here’s the thing — the part no one talks about — Dallas didn’t really stop. The city put on a show for the cameras, but behind closed doors, certain circles kept spinning. The parties never stopped. The scene never shut down. If anything, it got darker, louder, more intense.</p>
        <p>And yeah, I thought I could handle it. I told myself I had control, that I was just blowing off steam like everyone else. But looking back, I was chasing something. Connection. Escape. Maybe just a feeling of being seen.</p>
        <p>What I found instead was a fast-moving current I wasn’t ready for. One that looked like fun on the surface but pulled people under when no one was watching.</p>
        <p>I didn’t know it then, but that move — that one choice — would set off a chain of events that I’m still unpacking to this day.</p>
        <p>This is where it started. Not the glamorous version. Not the version curated for likes or status. The real one. The version that forces you to choose: disappear quietly… or survive loudly.</p>
