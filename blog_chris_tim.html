    <h1>🎭 The Scene I Didn't Audition For</h1>
    <p><strong>By Emmanuel Tarango</strong><br />TruthOnTheD.com</p>
  

  <main>
    <p>Shortly after I moved to Dallas, I met a man named Tim Johnson. He worked in theater — a managing director, well-spoken, professional. The kind of person you'd assume would know the difference between right and wrong, and how to treat people with basic dignity. We hung out a few times. He seemed like good people.</p>

    <p>Then one day, Tim shows up with this guy — <strong>Chris with the Mini</strong>. Yeah, I call him that on purpose. It’s a reference to his car, sure — but let’s be honest, it also works as a dig. Petty? Maybe. But that’s what he gets when you show up to someone’s place, act entitled, mock them, gaslight them, then deny it ever happened. He earned that nickname.</p>

    <p>That day marked one of the most surreal, humiliating experiences I’ve ever had: both of them mocked me — openly, and then had the nerve to deny it.</p>

    <p>I was in disbelief. I thought, <em>no, maybe I’m reading into it too much.</em> I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. I tried to make sense of it. <em>Surely someone like Tim — educated, professional, part of the creative world — wouldn’t go along with something like that.</em> But he did. And it wasn’t subtle.</p>

    <p>This was also the first time I met Chris. It wouldn’t be the last. I encountered him three more times. What’s strange is, I never remembered him — at all. I had such a mechanical way of removing toxic energy from my life, I literally forgot who he was each time. But each time, the vibe was the same: covert disrespect masked as sarcasm, the kind of fake laughs and backhanded comments that leave you questioning your own sanity.</p>

    <p>The last time, I finally said something. I told him he was insecure, maybe even jealous. He had been a guest in my home — twice — and still felt entitled to disrespect me. Looking back, I see now what I was too naïve to accept: <strong>it was racism.</strong></p>

    <p>Chris is from South Africa — a country that clung to institutional racism under Apartheid well into the 1990s. Tim, meanwhile, is part of Dallas’s creative theater scene — an industry notorious for marginalizing and tokenizing people of color. Their behavior wasn’t an isolated case of rudeness. It was <em>a pattern.</em> One that said, <em>you’re not welcome here.</em></p>

    <p>What stunned me most was the realization that it didn’t matter who I was. Not my behavior. Not my education. Not my professionalism. None of it shielded me from being targeted. In fact, my confidence — my refusal to shrink myself — may have been what provoked it.</p>

    <p>I didn’t want to believe that who I was — Mexican-American, masculine, spiritual, independent — was the problem. But now I know: it wasn’t <em>me.</em> It was <em>them.</em> And it was systemic.</p>

    <p>I debated how to tell this story. I chose to use names — not out of revenge, but for <strong>accountability</strong>. Because “Tim and Chris” aren’t just metaphors. They’re real people. They helped set the tone for what would become an ongoing pattern of harassment and psychological abuse in Dallas.</p>

    <p>Even after I left the city, it followed me.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>My <strong>iCloud was hacked.</strong></li>
      <li>My <strong>emails, medical records, financial files, and personal photos</strong> were stolen.</li>
      <li><strong>Compromising videos were taken without my knowledge</strong> and, I believe, distributed.</li>
      <li>People would approach me and reference private facts about my life — things no one should know.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This group not only had access to my digital life — they used it to <strong>target me, sabotage my job, disrupt my housing, and attack my mental health.</strong> Even my landlords and employers were reached. Emails were sent in my name that I didn’t write. Conversations I never had were orchestrated without my knowledge.</p>

    <p>In Texas, “revenge porn” is supposed to be automatically referred to the District Attorney. But when I asked <strong>Detective Joshua Brooks</strong> of the <strong>Dallas Police Department</strong> to refer my case, I was stonewalled. He told me he didn’t handle that kind of crime and redirected me elsewhere. I followed up. I got silence.<br>
    Meanwhile, the <strong>Dallas County District Attorney, Michael O’Brien</strong>, is close personal friends with people in the group — including <strong>Scott Jerold McCartney</strong>, the man I believe orchestrated much of this abuse.</p>

    <p>I asked for justice. What I got was indifference, protectionism, and institutional silence.</p>

    <p>This blog is my voice. My truth. My record.</p>

    <p>I don’t have the power to issue subpoenas. I can’t force Apple, Meta, or Google to reveal who logged into my accounts. I can’t access the IMEI numbers of the dozens of people who impersonated me on dating apps. But <strong>I can tell my story.</strong></p>

    <p>And by doing so, <strong>I will</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hold people accountable</li>
      <li>Give voice to others who’ve been targeted and silenced</li>
      <li>Prove that <em>no one is alone in this fight</em></li>
      <li>And make it undeniable: <strong>we will get justice — with or without permission</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn’t revenge. This is exposure.<br>
    This is <strong>Truth on the D.</strong></p>
