      <h1>I Reached Out to Dallas Voice — and Recalled My Encounter with Their Contributor, JD Trueblood</h1>
      <p><strong>Posted:</strong> August 1, 2025<br><strong>Category:</strong> Blog</p>
      <p>Last week, I reached out to <em>Dallas Voice</em>. I sent them a straightforward, factual pitch — an investigative story based on my experience being digitally stalked, impersonated, harassed, and sabotaged in Dallas. I mentioned the police reports. I gave them my DOJ Civil Rights Complaint ID (606262-MPH). I offered to share screenshots, evidence, and the names of those involved.</p>
      <p><strong>Their response?</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        “You need to speak with an attorney and law enforcement before speaking with the press.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>It was a polite dismissal. But in reading that email, I was immediately reminded of something that happened last year — and ironically, it involved one of their own contributors: <strong>JD Trueblood</strong>.</p>
      <p>We’ve never met in person. I only know him because he contacted me through a hookup app using a VOIP number. At first, it was the usual: some light flirting, wanting to PnP, sending a number. But then the tone shifted.</p>
      <p>He began referencing parts of my life no stranger would know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Old Facebook posts</li>
        <li>Email handles I haven’t used in years</li>
        <li>Reviews I had written, years ago, on public platforms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I traced the number he used. It was a dummy line — one of those free VOIP throwaways. So I called it.</p>
      <p>It rang through to a real phone number — and the voicemail message gave it away.</p>
      <p>I looked it up. It belonged to <strong>JD Trueblood</strong>.</p>
      <p>I sent him a message at that real number. He casually responded and asked if I wanted to grab a drink, like the whole thing never happened.</p>
      <p>He knew exactly what he was doing. And when caught, he just… moved on.</p>
      <p>So when <em>Dallas Voice</em> responded with that deflection, telling me they couldn’t publish my story, I couldn’t help but think back to JD — a contributor to their own paper — who had trolled me for sport just a year earlier.</p>
      <p>This is how they operate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Act like they don’t see it.</li>
        <li>Ignore the people who come forward.</li>
        <li>Stay silent when their own are involved.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That’s why I created <strong>TruthOnTheD.com</strong>.<br>
      Because if I don’t tell these stories, no one will.</p>
