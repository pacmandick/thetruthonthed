 <h1>About This Site</h1>
      <h2>Who Is This For?</h2>
      <p>This site is for anyone who’s been gaslit, stalked, hacked, impersonated, blacklisted, or quietly sabotaged — and told to “move on” or “let it go.”</p>
      <p>It’s for the ones who were pushed to the edge and then blamed for losing their balance.</p>
      <p>It’s also for the ones doing the pushing — the bitter ex, the smug burner-account troll, the so-called professionals hiding behind company logos and legal threats. That includes the landlords who looked the other way, the attorneys who played dumb, the corporations who ghosted, and the elected officials who shrugged and said, “Not my problem.” If you’re complicit in the silence, then this site’s for you too — just not in the way you hoped.</p>

      <h2>Why I Created This</h2>
      <p><strong>Let me be absolutely clear:</strong><br />
      This is the first time in my life I’ve ever exposed anyone publicly. And it’ll likely be the only time.</p>
      <p>I believe in privacy. I’ve lived by it. Even when I’ve been hurt, I’ve kept people’s secrets. That’s who I am.</p>
      <p>But these people don’t believe in privacy — not for others. They believe in control, manipulation, and destruction.</p>
      <p>And what they did to me crossed every line imaginable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Digital sabotage</li>
        <li>Stalking</li>
        <li>Impersonation</li>
        <li>Smear campaigns</li>
        <li>Isolation</li>
        <li>Psychological warfare</li>
        <li><em>Even an attempt on my life.</em> I was poisoned and had to call an ambulance. That story’s coming — it deserves its own post.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So no — this isn’t gossip. This isn’t revenge. <strong>This is self-defense.</strong></p>
      <p>I tried going through every proper channel. Police? Refused to refer my case. District Attorney? Won’t touch it unless it’s referred. A local attorney told me I had “no case” — not because there wasn’t one, but because of who I was going up against.</p>
      <p>So I built this. Because silence almost killed me — and I won’t die quietly.</p>

      <h2>This Is a Pattern</h2>
      <p>People like this project their fears and insecurities onto whoever they’re targeting. They use whisper campaigns, group dynamics, and gaslighting to isolate and disempower.</p>
      <p>But here’s the part they hate the most:<br /><strong>I don’t fold. I call it out. I document it. I put it online for the world to see.</strong></p>

      <h3>This is for:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Anyone who’s ever been digitally harassed, stalked, outed, sabotaged, or silenced.</li>
        <li>Anyone who feels like they’re going crazy — you’re not.</li>
        <li>Anyone who’s scared — this is how you take your power back.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This isn’t just storytelling. This is record-keeping. This is accountability. This is me standing the fuck up.</p>
      <p>So if you’re part of this?<br /><strong>Welcome to the fucking spotlight.</strong><br />
      Everyone else?<br /><strong>Let’s take our power back.</strong></p>
