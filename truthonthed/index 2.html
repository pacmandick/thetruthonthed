    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">About TruthOnTheD.com</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">TruthOnTheD.com is a platform built for one reason: to expose the truth that others have tried to bury. This isn’t a gossip blog. It’s a digital war room—documenting the tactics, lies, and abuse used by a coordinated network of predators operating behind masks of respectability and influence.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Founded by Emmanuel Tarango, a seasoned project manager and outspoken voice for digital justice, this site exists to shine a spotlight where others flinch away: targeted harassment, digital stalking, blackmail, and coordinated psychological warfare—all wrapped in silence.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Our Mission:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li>Expose the perpetrators who weaponize shame, technology, and status to harm others.</li>
      <li>Connect with survivors of similar abuse, especially those within marginalized communities.</li>
      <li>Pursue justice through transparency, legal action, and collective documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why This Matters:</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">Because this story isn’t just personal—it’s systemic. And for every person who speaks up, there are dozens who’ve been silenced. We believe in reclaiming power through exposure and using truth as leverage.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">This isn’t a jab at Dallas–Fort Worth or the surrounding communities. There are good people here—but there’s also a side to it that thrives in secrecy. Our goal is to explore the backbone of this behavior: what it is, what compels those who engage in it, and why it’s so pervasive. By going public, we can find others who will share their experiences. Together, we can break it down, identify the patterns, trace the source—and weaken it.</p>
    <p>This is dedicated to those who have been victimized. To those who lost their battle. And to those who are part of it: welcome to my D-List. That’s not a threat. It’s a spotlight.</p>
