<h1>It’s Not Your Imagination — Bluetooth + Wi-Fi Are All They Need</h1>
<p><em>It wasn’t the modem. It was proximity. And after that? Any connection would do.</em></p>
<p>I was told to chase the wrong problem — by people who acted like they were helping.</p>
<p>Ricky warned me about Cannon. Said he had hacked their phones, email, social, Wi-Fi — and the solution? “Just replace your modem.” I did. Twice. Didn’t change a thing.</p>
<p>Another guy showed up at my place and made comments that made it clear he knew what I was doing on my machine. He mocked the firewall, the router, the reformatting — said none of it mattered. And he was right. Because the modem wasn’t the problem. The proximity was.</p>
<h2>🔍 The Real Attack Vector: Proximity-Based Exploits</h2>
<p>This is what they use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bluebugging</strong> – remote control via Bluetooth</li>
<li><strong>Bluesnarfing</strong> – stealing messages, files, contacts</li>
<li><strong>KARMA attacks</strong> – spoofing trusted Wi-Fi names to auto-connect devices</li>
<li><strong>Evil Twin APs</strong> – faking legit Wi-Fi to intercept everything</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to open an attachment. You don’t even need to click. All it takes is Bluetooth or Wi-Fi enabled, and your device trying to reconnect to something it *thinks* is safe.</p>
<h2>💡 It’s Not About the Internet</h2>
<p>The modem was never the issue. Once they’re in — *any* connection becomes the tool. Wi-Fi, cellular, tethered, doesn’t matter. The initial exploit happens through proximity. Everything else is just the channel they ride afterward.</p>
<h2>🍏 What Apple Won’t Tell You</h2>
<p>Apple knows Bluetooth is insecure. But they can’t patch around it without breaking their ecosystem — AirDrop, Handoff, AirPods, etc. So instead? They downplay. They minimize. They ignore. When I reported what happened, they sent me home with a factory reset and a “have a nice day.”</p>
<h2>🛑 This Is By Design</h2>
<p>The goal is to waste your time. Make you reset things that don’t need resetting. Make you feel crazy. Make you give up. But now that I understand the pattern? I see it for what it is — and I’m not chasing the wrong enemy anymore.</p>
